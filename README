BESTTREES

BestTrees.jar contains the implementation of the algorithm presented in
"An Efficient Best-Trees Algorithm for Weighted Tree Automata over the Tropical 
Semiring" by Johanna Björklund, Frank Drewes, and Niklas Zechner for generating
the N best trees given a weighted tree automaton (WTA).

The file wta.format contains the description of the format of the input WTAs.
The example WTA from the paper can be found in wta0.rtg, and another example
used for testing is in wta1.rtg.

Run the .jar file by 

java -jar BestTrees.jar <RTG file> N [ --no-pruning | -timer ]

    N is an nonnegative integer
    --no-pruning runs the BestTreesBasic algorithm
    -timer compares BestTrees and BestTreesBasic
