BESTTREES

This repo contains the implementation of the BestTrees algorithm presented in
"An Efficient Best-Trees Algorithm for Weighted Tree Automata over the Tropical 
Semiring" by Johanna Björklund, Frank Drewes, and Niklas Zechner 
(http://www8.cs.umu.se/research/uminf/reports/2014/022/part1.pdf)
for generating the N best trees given a weighted tree automaton (WTA).

The file wta.format contains the description of the format of the input WTAs.
The example WTA from the paper (wta0.rtg) can be found along with other examples
used for testing in directory wta_examples/.

Quick start: 

Download and run the .jar file by 

java -jar BestTrees<version>.jar <RTG file> N [ --no-pruning | -both ] [-timer] 

    N is an nonnegative integer
    --no-pruning runs the BestTreesBasic algorithm
    -both runs both BestTrees and BestTreesBasic
    -timer measures the run-time for the algorithm(s)

Enjoy the forest.
