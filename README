BESTTREES

This repo contains the implementation of the BestTrees algorithm presented in
"An Efficient Best-Trees Algorithm for Weighted Tree Automata over the Tropical 
Semiring" by Johanna Björklund, Frank Drewes, and Niklas Zechner 
(http://www8.cs.umu.se/research/uminf/reports/2014/022/part1.pdf)
for generating the N best trees given a weighted tree automaton (WTA).

The file wta.format contains the description of the format of the input WTAs.
The example WTA from the paper (wta0.rtg) can be found along with other examples
used for testing in directory wta_examples/.

Quick start: 

Download and run the .jar file by 

java -jar BestTrees<current_version>.jar <RTG file> N [-v VERSION] [-timer] 

    N is an nonnegative integer 
    -v allows the user to select which version to run
    -timer measures the run-time for the algorithm(s)
    VERSION can be: 
    2 - runs BestTrees version 2 (pruned rule queue)
    1 - runs BestTrees version 1 (pruned tree queue)
    basic - runs the BestTreesBasic algorithm
    all - runs all versions

Enjoy the forest.
