BESTTREES

This repo contains the implementation of the BestTrees algorithm presented in
"An Efficient Best-Trees Algorithm for Weighted Tree Automata over the Tropical 
Semiring" by Johanna Björklund, Frank Drewes, and Niklas Zechner 
(http://www8.cs.umu.se/research/uminf/reports/2014/022/part1.pdf)
for generating the N best trees given a weighted tree automaton (WTA).

It now also contains as the default the implementation of the improved, 
transition-based algorithm (here called version 2). [Paper not yet published.]

The file wta.format contains the description of the format of the input WTAs.
The example WTA from the paper (wta0.rtg) can be found along with other examples
used for testing in directory wta_examples/.

Quick start: 

Download and run the .jar file by 

java -jar BestTrees<current_version>.jar [options]

options for BestTrees:
 -f,--file <wta file>        file containing the input wta
 -N <nonnegative integer>    number of trees wanted
 -s,---semiring <semiring>   semiring used for BestTrees (the default
                             semiring is the tropical semiring)
 -timer                      measures running time(s)
 -v,--version <arg>          version of BestTrees; arg can be
                             2 (uses a pruned rule queue),
                             1 (uses a pruned tree queue) or
                             all (runs all versions).
                             The default version is 2


Enjoy the forest.
